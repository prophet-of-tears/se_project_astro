        this site was created by me Jeremiah Partee as part of the final project
        for the tripleten bootcamp. It is a display of the skills I learned in
        the 10 month program and with the help of the tutors at tripleten, I
        hope it positively delivers on what an aspiring software engineer is
        capable of. the purpose of this website is to display to the user
        information on celestial objects such as stars, planets, constellations
        etc. and will serve as a reference to sky points for those with the
        proper equipment to be able to utilize.{" "}
